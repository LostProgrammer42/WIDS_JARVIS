## Getting Started

### Step 1: Basic Python Resources

Get familiar with syntax and environment of Python. In this step, you will also setup and install python in your devices. It is recommended that you follow the tutorials alongside coding instead of watching it like a movie . Here are some helpful resources:
- [Crash Course for Python](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=ruj5oirHJV8n-1t7)
- [Python Text Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

### Step 2: Numpy and Pandas
Get familiar with the libraries and their use. No need to forcefully memorize the syntax or the arguments of every function. With time and practice, you will automatically start remembering these. Some helpful resources:

-[Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIQJtJ38-hI)

### Step 3: Complete the assignment
The Assignment of Week-1 is divided into two parts. Both of these have their individual PDF's uploaded. Go through the assignment PDF's and write the code in the format specified. Create a github repository for the project and upload both the codes to the repo. At the end of the week, a google form will be floated wherein you will submit the repository link
