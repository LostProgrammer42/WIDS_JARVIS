# Week 3: Just A Rather Very Intelligent System - J.A.R.V.I.S

## Overview
Week-3 of the project involves learning the basics of Machine Learning. We will mainly focus on using **Sci-kit learn** also known as "sklearn" and cover it, however you are free to use any ML-Library like PyTorch or Tensorflow, for the final project, if you are familiar with them.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Basic Machine Learning Resources

Get familiar with the Machine Learning Models, how they work and how to implement them in Python. Here are some helpful resources:
- [Playlist for ML](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw&si=uQJAYLVMrWukME6X)
- [Scikit Learn Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/index.htm)
- [Scikit Learn Official Tutorials and Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/1.4/tutorial/index.html)

### Step 2: Complete the final project
The problem statement for the final project will be uploaded soon. Go through the assignment PDF's and write the code in the format specified. Upload the code in the same repository as of Week-1. At the end of the week, a google form will be floated wherein you will submit the repository link
